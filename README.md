## Feature 1

Farmers can track the lifecycle of their crops, from planting to harvest. A farmer can be able to: Create a new crop: Farmers can add a new crop including crop type, planting date, expected harvest date, and the planting field. The server generates a unique ID for the new crop.

**Read crop details**:  Farmers can access specific crop details using the unique crop ID. The server provides the details of the requested crop.

**Update crop details**:  Farmers can modify crop details, such as the expected harvest date. The server returns the updated crop details.

**Delete crop entry**:  Farmers can remove a crop entry, for instance, after the harvest and sale of the crop. The server confirms the deletion.

**List all crops**:  Farmers can retrieve a list of all their crops. The server returns a list containing details of all crops.
